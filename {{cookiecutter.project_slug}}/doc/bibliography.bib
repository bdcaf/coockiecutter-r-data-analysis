abstract = {We analysed the time evolution of several volatile organic compounds formed by the catabolism of ingested isotope-labelled ethanol using real-time breath gas analysis with proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometry. Isotope labelling allowed distinguishing the emerging volatile metabolites from their naturally occurring, highly abundant counterparts in the human breath. Due to an extremely low detection limit of the employed technologies in the parts per trillion per volume range, it was possible to detect the emerging metabolic products in exhaled breath within approximately 10 min after oral ingestion of isotope-labelled ethanol. We observed that ethanol was in part transformed into deuterated acetone and isoprene, reflecting the different fates of activated acetic acid (acetyl-coenzyme A), formed in ethanol metabolism. Using ethanol as a model clearly demonstrated the value of the here presented technique for the search for volatile markers for metabolic disorders in the exhaled breath and its potential usefulness in the diagnosis and monitoring of such diseases.},

@article{Moskovets2003,
abstract = {To utilize fully modern MALDI-TOF and TOF/TOF mass spectrometers
  with mass resolution exceeding 10,000 and 2 ppm precision of flight time
  	measurements for high mass accuracy, the model of ion motion used in the
  	mass calibration equation must be expanded. The standard three-term
  	equation providing up to 5-10 ppm (rms) mass accuracy with internal
  	standards was modified with an additional term accounting for the finite
  	rise time of the high-voltage extraction pulse. This new four-term
  	calibration equation minimizes the effect of systematic error resulting
  	from the fact that ion velocities are mass dependent due to the rise time
  	of the extraction pulse. Applying this new calibration equation to a mass
  	spectrum obtained in an axial MALDI-TOF MS containing 70 peaks (sodiated
  		PEG), each with a signal-to-noise ratio greater than 100, a mass
  	accuracy of 1.6 ppm (rms) was obtained over the mass range 1.0-4.0 kDa
  	compared with 3.6 ppm (rms) with the standard three-term equation. The
  	physical basis of the effects of the finite extraction pulse rise time on
  	mass calibration is examined for axial MALDI-TOF mass spectrometers, as
  	well as for orthogonal acceleration TOF mass spectrometers.},
